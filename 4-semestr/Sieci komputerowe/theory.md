Cables that can be found connected to your computer, router.

There are two types of such cables:

1) `UTP` [unshielded twisted pair] - common type of cable that is used today.

It consists of 4 pairs of colored-coded wires twisted around each other.

The wire are twisted to prevent electromagnetic interference.

2) `STP` [shielded twisted pair] - it is much the same thing as `UTP`, but it has a `foil shield` that covers the wires.

The foil shield adds a layer of protection against electromagnetic interference leaking into and out of the cables.

## The wire order in RJ45 connector.

The wire order is very important and that order will be different depending upon purpose of the cables.

There are two standards of twisted pair cable: `T568A` & `T568A` - they are the same, just with different wire order.

The most common types of twisted pair cables that are used today a LAN:

1) `Straight(patch) cable` - when both ends of a cable are wired using __the same__ standard. For example: both ends are `T568A`. The most common type of ethernet cable that's used on a LAN. They are used tto connect computer with hubs, switches, routers, or modems. `Connects dissimilar devices together`. .

1) `Crossover cable` - when both ends of a cable are wired using two different standards. For example: one ends `T568A` and other one `T568B`. They are used to connect two similar devices together. For example: two computers

## Categories (CAT)

Those wires can be different categories and differ from each other by speed. Categories 4 and 5 are no longer standard, but from 5e cables are a standard.

There are also category 8, its speed 40Gbps
